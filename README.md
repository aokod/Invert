### Invert
Gives users the ability to use a "dark mode" that uses the new CSS filter:invert() property to selectively invert colors or tune the contrast of their page.

This plugin uses three stylesheets: one for the dark mode (darkMode.css), one for the contrast (fixOpacity.css), and one that is applied when both options are chosen (bothModes.css).
